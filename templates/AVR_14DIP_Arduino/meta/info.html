<p>This is a template for starting a project which uses a 14-pin DIP AVR (ATtiny24, ATtiny44, or ATtiny84) with the Arduino programming environment. The template includes the ISP header.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/damellis/attiny">ATtiny</a> package should be used in the Arduino IDE to provide support for 14-pin AVRs.</p>
