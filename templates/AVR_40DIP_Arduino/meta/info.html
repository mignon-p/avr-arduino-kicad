<body>

<p>This is a template for starting a project which uses a 40-pin DIP AVR (ATmega8535, ATmega16, ATmega32, ATmega164, ATmega324, ATmega644, or ATmega1284) with the Arduino programming environment. The template includes the clock crystal, and the ISP header and FTDI (serial) header.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mcudude/MightyCore">MightyCore</a> package should be used in the Arduino IDE to provide support for 40-pin AVRs. This template assumes the &quot;Standard&quot; pinout described in the MightCore README.</p>

<p>This template is licensed under <a href="https://forum.kicad.info/t/kicad-library-licensing/7856">the same terms as the KiCad libraries</a>, which is the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, with an exception that says that electronic designs based on the template are not bound by the attribution and share-alike conditions.</p>
