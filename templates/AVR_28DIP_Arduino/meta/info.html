<p>This is a template for starting a project which uses a 28-pin DIP AVR (ATmega8, ATmega168, or ATmega328) with the Arduino programming environment. The template includes the clock crystal, and the ISP header and FTDI (serial) header.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone">this page</a> for more on creating a "breadboard" Arduino.</p>
